# Rotate-Array-Using-Circular-List
In this repository I have shared the way to rotate array using circular list in O(n) time.

This Algorith uses Circular Linked lists.
In many Real life problem we encounter situations where we required to rotate array efficiently.
In this repo I have presented A good way of rotating array by any position in O(n) time.

If Anyone has any suggestion about this code just raise an issue request.
Cheers...
